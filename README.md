1.	https://web.archive.org/web/20170130155126/http://www.brianwansink.com/phd-advice/the-grad-student-who-never-said-no (i.e., almost everything that is wrong with how some labs are run)
2.	https://peerj.com/preprints/2748/ (re-analysis finds more than 150 statistical inconsistencies in the four resulting papers alone)
